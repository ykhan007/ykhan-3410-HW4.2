# Homework 4.2 – Weighted Graphs and Dijkstra’s Algorithm

This project builds a weighted directed graph of seven cities left in the U.S. after the apocalypse.  
I used latitude and longitude coordinates for each city to calculate distances with a simple Haversine function.  
Only the allowed one-way edges from the assignment are included.

The program runs Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest routes and distances for four required trips:

- Gilroy → Lubbock  
- Gilroy → Zanesville  
- Tupelo → Fargo  
- Worcester → Gilroy
